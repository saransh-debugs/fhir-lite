# fhir-lite

IMP: This is not production ready. It is not intended to be used in such a manner. This project is independent of my previous work experiences. 
This is a small demo to showcase how fake FHIR data can be fetched from a server (HAPI server) and measuring metrics of it for the purpose of making a POC.
